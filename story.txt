There are very frist lines on Github. I am start learning how to become 'Developer'.
Honestly, it is my dream when i was young.
However, the dream get started in this year, 2016. Other words, i rock it at nearly 25 year old birth day.

A little bit miscellaneous things...
Somebody call me idiot when i try to do something #dream#over#myability (above this one). English, study abroad, IT, etc.
Good or not, i can do it or not?
I'm not sure but i will definitely try to reach it. Why?
_Nothing much_It's my dream :).
